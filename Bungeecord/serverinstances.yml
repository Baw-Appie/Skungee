# Skungee (Bungeecord) - The #1 Skript addon for Bungeecord.

# ServerInstances is like a cloud server system built into Skungee. You can create servers and add them to Bungeecord with simple Skript syntax.
# You can manage and control these servers through Skungee. This configuration file will allow you to define the defaults of the servers.

# This is a massive expansion to Skungee so it may be buggy at in first initial releases, more additions will constantly be added over time.

#                                                                 TUTORIAL
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#                 So lets start off with explaining how the ServerInstances work and how you should be setting up these bad boys.
#               First under the plugins/Skungee/ServerInstances/templates/ directory, you need to make a new directory for a server.
#                       This directory should be a normal name as this will be where a Skript Syntax looks for the name.
#                     Like `template "Example"` and the directory is named plugins/Skungee/ServerInstances/templates/Example
# These will be considered Templates, when you call one of these Templates, Skungee will copy a Template over to the plugins/Skungee/ServerInstances/running-servers/ directory.
#       The plugins/Skungee/ServerInstances/running-servers/ directory should not be touched as this is like a temporarily folder for running servers.

    # The default argument allows the server to start up without the outdated delay message.
    # If you're using PaperSpigot you can add the argument "-Dcom.mojang.eula.agree=true" to allow for the eula to be signed as true.
    # This argument is good if you're generating servers, otherwise the eula from the server directory will be used like normal.
