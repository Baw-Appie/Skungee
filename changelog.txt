Version: 1.0.8a

Changed:
- A lot of internal changes, let me know if any issues arise at https://github.com/TheLimeGlass/Skungee/issues
- Reduced Skungee's file size by 258%, It's only 470kb! But it's still the biggest addon, how? Magic.
- Changed some of the switch handlers into their own classes.

Added:
- Added the ability for handlers to handle multiple packet types.
- Yaw of bungeecord player, because why not.
ExprBungeePlayerYaw:
  enabled: true

  syntax:
  - '[Skungee] [(all [[of] the]|the)] bungee[[ ]cord] yaw[s] (of|from) [(player|uuid)[s]]
    %strings/players%'
  - '[Skungee] %strings/players%[''s] [(player|uuid)[s]] bungee[[ ]cord] yaw[s]'
- Pitch of bungeecord player, because why not.
ExprBungeePlayerPitch:

- Worked on the protocol injector more, and made a stable version to start building syntax off it now.
- Added a catch on protocol injector issues, to help prevent crashing the client.

Fixed:
- Fixed a ConcurrentModificationException in the protocol listener when disconnecting.
- Fixed GlobalScripts not loading in Skript versions under 2.2-dev31c.
- Fixed getting servers which broke last update.
- Fixed a bug that crashed players when joining.
